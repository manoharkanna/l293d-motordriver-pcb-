The L293D is a dual H-bridge IC that can control the speed and direction of two DC motors or a single stepper motor. It is widely used in robotics and embedded systems for motor control.

Features:
Supports two DC motors or one stepper motor.
Motor voltage supply: 5V - 12V (Vcc2).
Logic voltage supply: 5V (Vcc1).
Current output per channel: up to 600mA.
Pin headers for easy connection to a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP32).
Decoupling capacitors for noise reduction and stable operation.
Separate ground and power planes for motor and logic circuits to minimize interference.
